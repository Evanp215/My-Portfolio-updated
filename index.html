            <h2 class="section-header"> About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I first discovered programming while I was in high school.
                I had no idea what degree or career path I would pursue, 
                but after a little research and reading on the subject, I was certain 
                this was what I wanted to do. I had a passion for gaming and problem solving, so my first
                reaction was to attempt programing games through C#. However, after a short time, I became highly interested
                in designing websites.
            </p>
            <p>
                I attempted to learn on my own through online resources, videos, and books,
                but I wasn't making the progress I wanted to see. That's when I found Thinkful online,
                and after reading about their program, I decided to enroll.
            </p>
            <p>Almost immediately I was welcomed by a large community of other Thinkful students. Shortly after as
                I began the program, I felt myself learning faster and absorbing more information than I ever could
                before on my own.
